# Recommender-system
An app that will recommend you movies based on content and collaborative based filtering.The recommender recommends you on the basis of both content and collaborative based filtering and therefore is a hybrid recommender.For content based filtering ,on the basis of cast,director,overview,genres,keywords we have used cosine similarity for finding top 25 similar movies . In collaborative filtering we have used SVD algorithm to predict the ratings for a given user and after sorting returns top 5 movies for the user.
